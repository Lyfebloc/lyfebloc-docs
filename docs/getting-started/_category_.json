    Lyfebloc supports multiple blockchain networks, namely Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Avalanche, and Fantom. Each of these networks have their own native token that you would also need to pay for network transaction fees (aka gas).

    For example, to make a trade on Ethereum network, you will need some ETH as gas. Make sure that you have ETH in your crypto wallet. If you do not have any ETH, you will need to first acquire some from a centralized crypto exchange and send it to your wallet.
