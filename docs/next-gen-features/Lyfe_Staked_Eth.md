# Lyfe Staked Ethereum

With Lyfe Ether, you'll be able to earn interest on ETH in a simplified, secure, and DeFi-native manner by leveraging the `Lyfebloc ecosystem` to maximize staking yield.

There are three primary components to the Lyfe Ether system, `Lyfe Ether (lyfeETH)`, `Staked Lyfe Ether (slyfeETH)`, and the `Lyfebloc ETH Minter`:

1. The `lyfeETH` stablecoin is loosely tied to the Ethereum
2. With `slyfeETH`, the staking yield is accrued. All profits generated by Lyfebloc Ether validators are distributed to `slyfeETH` holders. By exchanging lyfeETH for `slyfeETH`, one becomes eligible for staking yield, which can be redeemed when one converts `slyfeETH` back to `lyfeETH`.
3. The `Lyfebloc ETH Minter (lyfeETHMinter)` exchanges ETH for `lyfeETH`, bringing the ETH into the `Lyfebloc ecosystem`, spinning up new validator nodes when possible, and minting new `lyfeETH` at the rate of the sent ETH.
